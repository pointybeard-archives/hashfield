Hash Field
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Symphony Team (team@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 13th April 2008
Requirements: Symphony Beta revision 5 or greater.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'hashfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Hash", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Hash" field to your sections.


[USAGE]

- When a value is saved, if the length is not equal to 32 characters long (or is 32 characters long but 
not a valid hash string), it will hash the value before inserting into the database. 
The original is NOT saved. It is a one way operation.

- Filtering works in similar way. If the value length is not equal to 32 (or is 32 characters long but 
not a valid hash string), it will be hashed before comparing.
